# QueueUp - [Webiste](https://queue-up.vercel.app/)
- Instead of social distancing let's call it virtual connecting!
- This system places customers in a virtual waiting line. Aids in social distancing to reduce the spread of covid infection.

## Team Project - This is the team Project made by [Neha Kumari](https://github.com/NehaVns) and [Suryansh Prajapati](https://github.com/Suryansh1720001) under an ideathon.

#### This is a demonstration website where we address the queuing system issue, specifically at corona time.
## 🏆 We won the 2nd Prize in this ideathon.
